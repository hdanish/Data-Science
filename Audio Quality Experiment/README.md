# Description

For the [Data Science W241 Experiments and Causal Inference](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/241) class in the UC Berkeley MIDS program, my colleague Jasen Jones and I designed an experiment with the aim to answer the question of whether audio quality affects a userâ€™s enjoyment of music.
