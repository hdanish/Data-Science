# Description
The content here is all inspired from assignments completed for the [Data Science W207 Applied Machine Learning](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/207) class in the UC Berkeley MIDS program. These examples are presented using Python in Jupyter notebooks and they make use of re (regex module), numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn.

* **Digit Classification of MNIST data:** Using the popular [MNIST database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), I implement a image recognition system using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) and the naive Bayes classifier (NB).
* **Topic Classication:** Using text data from newsgroup postings, I implement classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text using KNN, NB and logistic regression (LR).
* **Exploring Properties of Mushrooms:** Using a classic dataset featuring over 8000 observations of mushrooms described using a variety of features and whether the mushrooms are poisonous or not, I use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality to visualize the data. I then experiment with clustering using KMeans and density estimation using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
* **Influencers in Social Networks:** This was a group project done based on the a [Kaggle competition for predicting which people are influential in a social network](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-who-is-more-influential-in-a-social-network/data). Our submission makes use of PCA, LR and ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and random forests. The notebook is hosted on my colleague [Nick Hamlin's GitHub](https://github.com/nickhamlin/mids_207_final_project/blob/master/207%20Final%20Project%20-%20Byun%2C%20Chio%2C%20Danish%2C%20Hamlin%2C%20Pazo.ipynb).
